To extend your access to the Quandl API, use your authentication token. To do this sign into your account (or create one) and go to your [account info page](https://www.quandl.com/account). Then copy your authentication token and type (with quotes):

    Quandl.auth("authenticationtoken")

This will then extend your usage.

    plot(stl(Quandl("GOOG/NASDAQ_GOOG",type="ts",collapse="monthly")[,1],s.window="per"))

    
## Search ##
Searching Quandl from within the R console is now supported. An authorization token is not required, but for extended use specify your token using `Quandl.auth()`.  The search function is:

    Quandl.search(query = "Search Term", page = n, source = "Specific source to search", silent = TRUE|FALSE)

* **Query**: Required; Your search term, as a string
* **Page**: Optional; page number of search you wish returned, defaults to 1.
* **Source**: Optional; Name of a specific source you wish to search, as a string
* **Silent**: Optional; specifies whether you wish the first three results printed to the console, defaults to True (see example below).

Which returns a list containing the following information for every item returned by the search:

* Name
* Quandl code
* Description
* Frequency
* Column names
